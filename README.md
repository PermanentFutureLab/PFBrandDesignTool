# How to work on this
We don't use regular HTML or CSS but rather use Jade and Stylus to declare our HTML and CSS. It's faster to type and easier to maintain.
To kickstart your development easily we use the Harp-server to serve those files. Harp doesn't need any configuration upon install.

- If you have installed Node, just run `sudo npm install -g harp`
- Clone this repo
- cd to the repo's folder and run `harp server pflab-design-tool`
